            <h3>ABOUT PAFA</h3>
            <p>
              The <strong>Public Accountability Footage Archive (PAFA)</strong> is an independent, non-profit
              archive publishing original law enforcement and public safety footage for public accountability,
              journalism, legal research, and historical documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              PAFA was established in 2022. All records in this archive are sourced, reviewed, and published
              exclusively by PAFA administration. <strong>PAFA does not accept public submissions.</strong>
              Footage is obtained through official agency releases, public records (FOIA) productions, and
              authorized distributions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>PAFA is not a government website.</strong> PAFA is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected
              to any law enforcement agency, government department, or official body. The use of a governmental
              aesthetic reflects the archive's focus on public record and accountability materials.
            </p>

          <div class="about-section">
            <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
            <p>
              PAFA exists to support <strong>public accountability, transparency, journalism, legal research,
              and historical documentation</strong> through the preservation of and access to links of real footage
              documenting interactions between the public and law enforcement, government surveillance systems,
              and other related video documentation.
            </p>
            <p>We believe that:</p>
            <ul class="policy-list">
              <li>Publicly available footage should be organized and accessible</li>
              <li>Documented incidents serve the public interest when preserved</li>
              <li>Journalists, researchers, attorneys, and citizens benefit from centralized footage archives</li>
              <li>Transparency in policing and government activity is a public good</li>
              <li>Publicly released or publicly visible footage is part of the historical record</li>

            <h3>HOW THE ARCHIVE WORKS</h3>
            <p>
              PAFA operates as a <strong>link archive</strong>. We do not host, store, upload, or re-distribute any
              video files. All footage remains hosted on its original platform (YouTube, Vimeo, Rumble, news sites,
              direct links, etc.). PAFA stores only the following metadata:

            <p>

                During our standard internal review process, PAFA staff examine each record to verify
                authenticity and identify any sensitive elements. In some cases, reviewers may annotate or
                note redacted sections within the record. <strong>This is noted in the entry for
